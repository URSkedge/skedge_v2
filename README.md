## Based on [Dan Hassin (UR'16)](https://github.com/dingbat)'s fabulous [Skedge](https://github.com/RocHack/skedge).

## Motivation for V2
* Skedge is no longer maintained :(
* Library dependencies are out of date, and contribution requires working knowledge of both React and Rails.

## Goals for V2
* Make Skedge great again!
* Separation of front-end and back-end logic and update library dependencies so that more folks can contribute without having to know both React and Rails.

## V2 at DandyHack
* Duncan & Zino
* 24 hours
* Course search and scheduling

## What's next?
* We're counting on you all to contribute!
* Make Skedge V2 a learning resource for all students interested in Web.
